Rock paper scissors using EJB

Seems pretty easy to either just use the options in netbeans:

Team > Git > Clone... 

Or to just clone it through the cli and then open the project folder in netbeans. 

What you'll need: 
1. Glassfish installed along with netbeans 
2. A local test db for the users ->

We're using JDB because it's the easiest integrated option for the coursework. My test table is as follows:

Users(Username(PK), Password, Score)
as VARCHAR, VARCHAR, and INT respectively. 

Make sure you try building it before you start work, I don't know if there's anything essential I have locally that I haven't pushed
