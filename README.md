Rock paper scissors using EJB

Seems pretty easy to either just use the options in netbeans:

Team > Git > Clone... 

Or to just clone it through the cli and then open the project folder in netbeans. 

What you'll need: 
1. Glassfish installed along with netbeans 
2. A local test db for the users ->

We're using JDB because we only need small table and it's the easiest integrated option for the coursework. My test DB is as follows:

Users(Username, ID, Password, Score)
robin,1,robin,0
aatish,2,aatish,0
bryn,3,bryn,0

I can always send y'all a copy of the DB, it's just not included in repo of course and it seems possibly easier to just a local one up for yourself. 

Make sure you try building it before you start work, I don't know if there's anything essential I have locally that I haven't pushed
